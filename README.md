This repository contains the the logic of dialogue planner. It is deployed as a Flask python application with an SQLAlchemy database that is supposed to store solutiions generated by planner.

## 1. Running the app

### Local Run

Install the dependencies listed in the requirements.txt file to be able to run the app locally.

  ```
pip install -r requirements.txt
  ```

Run the app. You can replace ``local_data/updated_gold_standard_bot`` with the path to any directory populated with valid [plan4dial](https://github.com/dialogue-planning/plan4dial) generated files.
  ```
python contingent_plan_executor/app.py local_data/updated_gold_standard_bot
  ```

### Docker Run (Recommended)
With Docker installed, run this command in the terminal to build the image:

docker build -t hovor:latest .

Once the image is built, you have two options for running the container:

#### a. In-Memory/Unmounted Run:
Use this version if you want to run a conversation that deletes once the container is
removed. (This is most ideal for testing).

``docker run -it --rm -p 5000:5000 -d hovor:latest local_data/updated_gold_standard_bot``

#### b. Persistent/Mounted Run:
Use this version to persist conversation. data.  
``docker run -it --rm -p 5000:5000 -d -v convo_data:/data hovor:latest local_data/updated_gold_standard_bot``

## 2. API endpoints

**TODO: UPDATE**
The root of execution monitor API endpoint is `[REPLACE WHEN HOSTED]`.

Below are the various sub-endpoints and explanation of the services they provide along with necessary input/output to/from them. Note that for any endpoint, an unsuccessful call will have an "error" status, and you can view the "msg" to see what went wrong.

### /new-conversation
#### GET:
Begins a new conversation. Returns the agent's message(s) under "msg" and the user's id under "user_id". **Be sure to store the "user_id" so you can load your conversation later!**

#### POST:
##### parameters: 
- "user_id": the user_id that identifies your save slot
Begins a new conversation, but **overwrites the existing user save slot if it exists.** 
Returns the same as the **GET** request, but keeps the same "user_id".

### /new-message
#### POST:
##### parameters:
- "user_id": the user_id that identifies your save slot
- "msg": the message you want to send to the agent
Sends a message to the agent speaking to the given "user_id". Returns the agent's message(s) under "msg". Other diagnostic information like "confidence" is also returned.

### /load-conversation
#### POST:
##### parameters:
- "user_id": the user_id that identifies your save slot

Loads the conversation of the given "user_id" in its most recent save state. Returns the agent's message(s) under "msg". Call the **new-message** endpoint to continue the conversation.
